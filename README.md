### Courage wolf here to give courage for the journey ahead.
</br></br>

I have previously created and used Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) with the help
of the MATLAB System Identification (essentially for regression) for
training an ANN on simulation data of UAV landing gear shock absorbtion and
suspension characteristics when rolling over different kind of runways and under
multiple simulated base excitations. But I did not know of the mathematics involved.

### So.
I want to break apart the Machine Learning(ML) algorithms and understand them.</br>
Moreover, we have so much amazing AI and ML toolboxes such as Tensorflow, Keras,
scikit-learn that many people are able to create amazing things. However at the
expense of not fully understanding the concepts involved in such libraries and
hence not able to essentialy create optimised solutions for the problems that
they are trying to solve.</br>

Enough said. Let's get coding.

We will need a mascot.</br>
A mascot to build a better community, and be a symbol of professionalism and friendship.
I present to you ladies and gentlemen , "Zengu" the baby zen penguin.</br>
She is smart, talented, loves introducing people to ML and wants to win a Nobel prize.

### Status
+ **I started on July-2-2018 learning ML with a simple linear regression; now today on July-12-2018, I implemented a neural network with multiple hidden layers , ReLU based neuron activation and back-propagation based learning method from scratch using only numpy.**
### Contents
ML is vast. And I do not want to pollute my github repo with learning material.
So all ML related learning and practice code will be in this repo.
And they are...
+ **src/01_soup_sale.py** : Linear regression using ordinary least square
	- Winter season temperature vs hot soup sale. Yum!
	- We fit a line through the data points using linear regresion.
	- RESULT </br> ![soup-img](images/01_soup_sale_05.JPG)
	- More images in images/ folder.
+ **src/02_soup_sale_gradient_descent.py** : Linear regerssion with gradient descent
	- Winter season temperature vs total soup sale.
	- We do linear regression using gradient descent algorithm
	- We used a constant learning rate, which is good but needs to made variable.
	- RESULT </br> ![soup-2-img](images/02_soup_sale_gradient_descent_01.JPG)
	- The blue transparent lines indicate the position of the line when in training.
	- The red opaque line indicate the final line created after completion of iterations
	- More images in images/ folder.
+ **src/03_perceptron.py** : It's a freaking perceptron based classifier !! (Kyaaah!!! XD)
	- We made a red ball black ball classifier using a perceptron.
	- A perceptron is basically an Aritficial Neural Network with one neuron.
	- What you think it's simple,so it is not important?
		- My silly friend. This is the powerhouse that can be scaled up to tremendous levels.
	- Any thing above the blue line is supposed to be red(+1) and all that is below is to be black(-1)
	- We train our perceptron on 100x8 , 100x10 and 100x30 data points using supervised learning.
	- The training essentialy modifies the weights of the perceptron.
	- Then we call it to guess and classify the data points and we plot it
	- RESULTS for 100*8 data points </br> ![perceptron-1](images/03_perceptron_01_100x8_nodes.JPG)
	- It can be seen the classification failed miserably! It is because, we did not have enough data points.
	- RESULTS for 100*10 data points </br> ![perceptron-2](images/03_perceptron_02_100x10_nodes.JPG)
	- We can see the results improved , but still some balls are not classified correctly
	- RESULTS for 100*30 data points </br> ![perceptron-3](images/03_perceptron_03_100x30_nodes.JPG)
	- The final one is just pure bliss !! Waaaaaah !!! XD
+ **src/04_perceptron_biased.py** : It's again a single layer perceptron but now with activation bias. WOW!
	- We improved the previous red ball black ball classifier using activation bias.
	- Overhauled all the linear algebra to pure numpy operations instead of loops resulting in 6x speed up.
	- Oh yeah! Added a linear function creator to allow changing our dividing blue line.
	- Trained on 1000 data points for 500,1000 and 5000 epochs.
	- Then created random validation data for classification and plotted the results of the classification.
	- RESULTS for 500 epochs </br> ![04_01](images/04_perceptron_biased_01_1000_nodes_500_epoch.JPG)
	- We can see the results are horrible meaning the perceptron needs more training.
	- RESULTS for 1000 epochs </br> ![04_02](images/04_perceptron_biased_02_1000_nodes_1000_epoch.JPG)
	- We can see the results improved but still some error is present around the dividing line.
	- RESULTS for 5000 epochs </br> ![04_03](images/04_perceptron_biased_03_1000_nodes_5000_epoch.JPG)
	- The results are amazing!
	- RESULTS for a different linear dividing line after 5000 epochs</br> ![04_04](images/04_perceptron_biased_04_1000_nodes_5000_epoch.JPG)
	- This is cool!
+ **src/05_neural_network.py** : It's an awesome neural network with multiple hidden layers. (Like a Boss!)
	- I have implemented ReLU based neuron activation, biased activation, learning method using gradient descent implemented by back-propagation, full numpy based linear algebra. I used it to do predict the marks obtained by a student based on how many hours the student studied and slept the previous night.
